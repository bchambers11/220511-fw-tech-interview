**How would you go about locating the cause of a stack overflow or watchdog timer reset?**

I would begin troubleshooting this problem by adding a debug variable with a distinct value and a print statement to each of the tasks in the software I suspect could be causing the problem. The last printed value before the program resets or fails should tell you what task was last running. Also, looking at all the print statements would show you if a certain ISR is getting called more often than expected or if some other task is hanging up. Adding and printing a counter to certain tasks may help in the process. Additionally, I know most watchdog timer resets can be configured so an interrupt will be triggered just before the reset. Using this interrupt I would save the value of the debug counter into flash, or print it one last time if there is time. This way it will hopefully be apparent what is causing the problems.
